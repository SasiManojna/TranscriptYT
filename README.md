## How to Implement This Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SasiManojna/TranscriptYT.git
cd TranscriptYT
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up the `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following content:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key
```

Replace `your_actual_google_api_key` with your actual Google Gemini API key.

### 5. Run the Application

Start the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### 6. Using the Application

- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
- Enter the YouTube video URL and the desired settings.
- Generate and download the transcript, summary, or audio file as needed.

### 7. Static Files and Templates

- **Static Files**: All static assets like CSS, JS, and audio files are stored in the `static/` directory.
- **Templates**: HTML files for the app's frontend are in the `templates/` directory.

### 8. Notes

- Ensure that the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is valid and has the required permissions for Google Gemini AI.
- If issues arise with the YouTube Transcript API, ensure that the video has transcripts available.
